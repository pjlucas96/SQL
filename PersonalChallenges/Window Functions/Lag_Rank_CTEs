/*
Find the highest Order value for each month in 2020 and 2021.
Calculate the difference between the highest order value (sales) for each month in 2021 to the highest order value for the same month in 2020.
Note that some difference values will be negative, ensure you convert these to positive.
Speak up if you need a hint.

EXTENSION:
Order the Months in 2021 by the difference calculated above and create a ranking calculation to rank them with the greatest increase in difference being rank 1.
Your output for the extension should only contain the months of 2021.
