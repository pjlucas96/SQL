I've worked hard on enabling SQL within The Data School NY since I moved from London in September 2023.
The files within this folder as well as the Window Functions folder are exercises that I've either found or prepared for our Consultants to support their upskilling in SQL.
I run the workshop once a week, usually on a Wednesday lunch time with around 20-25% of our consultants consistently showing up to practice their SQL skills.

The format:
 - I set questions for the workshop that the consultants will tackle.
 - I'm there for support to guide them in the right direction or discuss other ways of getting to the correct answer.
 - I perform a walk-through of the exercises as the class goes on so that the consultants can understand the journey I take to get to the final answer.
